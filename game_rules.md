# Crazy 8s


## General

* Standard 52-card pack
* 2-5 players (3players)
* Goal: get the least 100 points
* The player to get rid of all their cards first, wins the round



##  Card Values

The player who is the first to have no cards left wins the game. The  winning player collects from each other player the value of the cards  remaining in that playerâ€™s hand as follows:

* Each eight = 50 points
* Each K, Q, J or 10 = 10 points
* Each ace = 1 point
* Each other card is the according value



## Start

* Everyone gets 5 cards
* The one to joins first, starts
* Play in the order of joining the game
* The first card is never an 8



## Play

* Every card (other than eight) you play must match the suit or denomination of the card on the deck.
* The eights are crazy! Play it at anytime and define a new suit. The next player must play an eigt or a card of matching suit. 
* If you can't play, draw cards until you can play. 
* If the deck is empty and you can't play you are passed
